üîß Use Cases
</br>
</br>
Securing public-facing APIs and web apps in production
</br>
Adding L7 security to Kubernetes ingress with minimal configuration
</br>
Integrating custom security policies into CI/CD pipelines
</br>
Blocking known botnets or abusive crawlers
</br>
Enhancing compliance posture (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
</br>
üì¶ Architecture
</br>

The controller intercepts ingress traffic at L7 (HTTP/S), applies user-defined or default security policies, and forwards only clean traffic to backend services. It supports both inline and sidecar deployment modes.

The Application Security Ingress Controller fulfills the Kubernetes Ingress resources and allows you to manage Application Security objects from Kubernetes. It is deployed in a container of a pod in a Kubernetes cluster. The list below outlines the major functionalities of the Application Security Ingress Controller: 

 - To list and watch Ingress related resources, such as Ingress, Service, Node and Secret. 
 - To convert Ingress related resources to Application Security objects, such as virtual server, content routing, real server pool, and more.
 - To handle Add/Update/Delete events for watched Ingress resources and automatically implement corresponding actions on Application Security.
 
 


Ingress is a Kubernetes object that manages the external access to services in a Kubernetes cluster (typically HTTP/HTTPS). Ingress may provide load-balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

The Application Security Ingress Controller combines the capabilities of an Ingress resource with the Ingress-managed load balancer, Application Security. 

Application Security, as the Ingress-managed load balancer, not only provides flexibility in load-balancing, but also guarantees more security with features such as the Web Application Firewall (WAF), Antivirus Scanning, and Denial of Service (DoS) prevention to protect the web server resources in the Kubernetes cluster. Other features such as health check, traffic log management, and view on Application Security facilitates the management of the Kubernetes ingress resources.

# Installation
Install the Application Security Ingress Controller using Helm Charts.

:bulb: Currently, only Helm 3 (version 3.6.3 or later) is supported.

Helm Charts ease the installation of the Application Security Ingress Controller in the Kubernetes cluster. By using the Helm 3 installation tool, most of the Kubernetes objects required for the Application Security Ingress Controller can be deployed in one simple command. 

The Kubernetes objects required for the Application Security Ingress Controller are listed below:

|Kubernetes object| Description |
|--|--|
| Deployment | By configuring the replica and pod template in the Kubernetes deployment, the deployment ensures the Application Security Ingress Controller provides a non-terminated service. |
| Service Account | The service account is used in the Application Security Ingress Controller. |
| Cluster Role | A cluster role defines the permission on the Kubernetes cluster-scoped Ingress-related objects |
| Cluster Role Binding |The cluster role is bound to the service account used for the Application Security Ingress Controller, allowing the Application Security Ingress Controller to access and operate the Kubernetes cluster-scoped Ingress-related objects. |
| Ingress Class |The IngressClass "application-security-ingress-controller" is created for the Application Security Ingress Controller to identify the Ingress resource. If the Ingress is defined with the IngressClass "as-ingress-controller", the Application Security Ingress Controller will manage this Ingress resource. |

To get the verbose output, add --debug option for all the Helm commands.

# Configuration parameters
## Application Security Authentication Secret

As shown in above figure, the Application Security Ingress Controller satisfies an Ingress by Application Security REST API call, so the authentication parameters of the Application Security must be known to the Application Security Ingress Controller.

To preserve the authentication securely on the Kubernetes cluster, you can save it with the Kubernetes secret. For example

    kubectl create secret generic as-login -n [namespace] --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=[admin password]

The secret is named as-login. This value will be specified in the Ingress annotation "Application Security-login" for the Application Security Ingress Controller to get permission access on the Application Security.

:warning:  The namespace of the authentication secret must be the same as the Ingress which references this authentication secret.

## Annotation in Ingress

# Deployment of a Simple-fanout Ingress Example



In this example, the client can access service1 with the URL https://test.com/info and access service2 with the
URL https://test.com/hello.
Service1 defines a logical set of Pods with the label run=sise. Sise is a simple HTTP web server.
Service2 defines a logical set of Pods with the label run=nginx-demo. Nginx is also a simple HTTP web server.
Services are deployed under the namespace default.

## Deploy the Pods and expose the Services

Service1:

    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/application-security-ingress/main/service_examples/service1.yaml
Service2:

    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/application-security-ingress/main/service_examples/service2.yaml

## Deploy the Ingress

Download the simple-fanout-example.yaml


    curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/application-security-ingress/main/ingress_examples/simple-fanout-example.yaml -o simple-fanout-example.yaml

Modify the Ingress Annotation in simple-fanout-example.yaml to accommodate to your environment, ex: Application Security-ip, virtual-server-ip, etc.. Then deploy the ingress with kubectl command

    kubectl apply -f simple-fanout-example.yaml
